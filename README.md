Small battery status for the command-line - ‚ö†Ô∏è Mac OS only ‚ö†Ô∏è

`This is a replacement for the batstat.sh script.`

## \_about

`bettery` is a small and fast tool for checking your battery status in your terminal.
I develeoped it to use it with `tmux` and it fits in perfectly.

Make sure your terminal supports **Nerd Fonts** or else the icons will not be displayed.

If you find any bugs or weird behavior, please create a `issue` and if you want to contribute, feel free and create a PR
or fork the repo.

## \_build

It's as simple as downloading/cloning the repo and running the `make install` command.

`make install` builds the tool and places it in your global binarys folder (/usr/local/bin).

After that you can run the `bettery` command from anywhere in your terminal.

## \_icons

Big thanks to ![Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) for providing all the used icons.
